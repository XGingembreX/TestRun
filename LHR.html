<h1 style="text-align: center;">Laser Hair Removal</h1>
<div class="information" id="information">
  <h3>What is Laser Hair Removal?</h3>
  The laser emits a invisible highly concentrated, single wavelength beam of light.
  When the laser source is pulsed, the light energy is conducted as intense thermal heat.
  The pulse duration, spot size, and influence determine how much heat is absorbed by the mealanin in the hair folicle.
  The pulse of light is delievered just long enough to heat up the pigment, disabling the hair folicle to elimate or significantly impede the hair's growth.
  To impair the development of the stem cells within the bulge of the hair folicle & destruction of blood supply in the bulb is the key to permanent epilation.
  Darker hairs respond more effectively than lighter coloured hairs. 
  Brown, dark drown and black are the best targets with the highest efficacy of clearance.
  Laser causes destruction of the hair folicle when the concentration of a pigment is higher in the hair folicle than the skin.<br><br>

  <h3>How long does results last?</h3>
  At any given time, a certain percentge of your hair will be in a "resting" phase. 
  Hair removal is not effective on hair in a dormant phase.
  Due to variables of the numbers of hairs in the resting phase, certain parts of the body will respond more rapidly than others.
  Multiple treatments may be needed for desired amount of clearance. 
  Due to hormonal or genetic influences some clients periodically need maintence treatments to maintain the improvement. 
  With 4 to 6 laser treatments one can obtain a 50-60% hair reduction. 
  20-30% hair loss can be expected with each treatment. 
  90% is a long-term clearance rate. 
  White, blonde, red and grey hair is difficult due to limited amounts of pigment. 
  Coarser hair is easier to treat due to having a higher amount of pigment and a greater diameter shaft.
  All laser systems produce a temporary removal effect.
